# golang.to website

This repository contains the source and content for the [golang.to](https://golang.to) website.

The primary goal is to:

- keep track of meetups and other events related to Go in Toronto

A secondary, and more ambitious goal:

- jot down a recap of the meetups and events for those unable to attend
